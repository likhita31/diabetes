The dataset we are going to use comes from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and contains anonymized diagnostic measurements for a set of female patients. We have trained a support vector machine to predict whether a new patient has diabetes based on such measurements. 
We have used 
- flask to create a api for our model
- css and html to personalize the webpage
- Docker container to give our application platform independence
